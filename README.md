# Stock Price Analyser

This project is a simple Python script that fetches historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance, analyzes the data using Pandas, and visualizes it using Matplotlib. The script uses the `yfinance` library to fetch the stock data, making it easy to get accurate and up-to-date information .

## Importance

The importance of this project lies in its ability to help users:

1. Retrieve historical stock price data efficiently and reliably.
2. Analyze stock price trends over time using Pandas, a powerful data analysis library.
3. Visualize stock price data, making it easier to understand the performance of a stock over a specified period.
4. Use the script as a starting point for more advanced stock analysis or trading strategies.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib
```

2. Clone the repository or download the `stock_scraper.py` file.

3. Replace the `stock_symbol` variable in the `stock_scraper.py` file with the desired stock's symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple Inc., "GOOG" for Google, or "AMZN" for Amazon).

4. Run the script using:

```bash
python stock_scraper.py
```

5. The script will generate a plot displaying the historical closing prices of the specified stock.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the `start` and `end` parameters in the `yf.download()` function to analyze different date ranges or adjust the visualization settings to fit your preferences.
